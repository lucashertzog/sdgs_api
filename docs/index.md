# Welcome

Welcome to the course on Ocean Development Indicators in R. This book provides all the necessary materials and instructions.

## Context

Ocean accounting provides comprehensive indicators of mainstream ocean contributions to society, and the SDG indicators can be used as a starting point for highlighting gaps.

-   Identify which indicators are available in the context of the country.

-   Transboundary cooperation (starting point looking at other countries)

-   Open and freely accessible data.

## Training Objectives

-   Learn to extract, clean, and analyse UN Global SDG Database data using R and the UN SDG API.

-   Provide foundational knowledge on interacting with GitHub using R within the workshop context.

-   Enable participants to build indicators informed by global standards but tailored to their specific contexts.

## Introductions

-   What is a sociologist doing here?

-   My areas of interest are 1) sociology and public health, 2) hacking and statistics, and 3) climate change and sustainable transitions.

-   The Data Science Venn Diagram

-   Participants' names, organisations, and where they stand in the Venn Diagram.
